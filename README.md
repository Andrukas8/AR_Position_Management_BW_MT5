This EA allows to manage the position by trailing stops according to Fractals or/and Moving Averages

Once you place your positions, drag this EA onto the chart and in the input dialog select the trailing stops and breakeven method you would like to use.

If the Break Even Ratio is "0" the break even function will be diabled. If it is for example 2, the positions on the chart will break even once the price reaches 2xRR.
